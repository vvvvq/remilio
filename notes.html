                    Redacted Remilio Babies is a collection of 
                    10,000 neochibi pfpNFT's evolving the Milady Maker 
                    paradigm with the introduction of young J.I.T. energy, 
                    reactionary aesthetics, and the zoomer memetic mog. 
                    We are #REMILIONAIRE’s.

Remilio Congregation is a proud Elite Splinter Force 
Romanian Black Ops Banned Division of the Remilia Collective. 
Featuring art by Ulenka, direction by “Q2”, consultancy by the 
Yayo Corporation, and oversight by Charlotte Fang’s intern. 
The design extends FODCORP’s derivative of Milady Sonora Sprite’s 
“OG Milady” predating the Milady Maker NFT.

                    John Lemaire is a digital painter
                    who has shown works in galleries both
                    physically and digitally through
                    Remilia Collective under this psuedonym.
                    <br><br>
                    His style blends the optimism and obstinate egoism at the
                    heart of convincing rhetoric that elevates Sales into a
                    medium of art. Remilios are informed by tropes of money
                    twitter, 2010s juvenile internet culture, and schizophrenic right wing extremism
                    <br><br>
                    Remilios swept the timeline with a wave of naive, adolescent
                    energy, channeling these inspirations into the same
                    directed chaos that sets Milady apart from the monotony
                    of NFT- and crypto-twitter as a community, the same ludic
                    metairony has always been the essence of genuine internet culture.

                    He developed his distinctive take
                    on the Esoteric Sales style in a portraiture
                    series over the years, one which invokes a
                    calming, ethereal, white-hearted angelicism
                    in a blend of Western and Japanese aesthetics.
                    Remilio Maker is Milady for boys.
