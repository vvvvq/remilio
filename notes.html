                    John Lemaire is a digital painter
                    who has shown works in galleries both
                    physically and digitally through
                    Remilia Collective under this psuedonym.
                    <br><br>
                    His style blends the optimism and obstinate egoism at the
                    heart of convincing rhetoric that elevates Sales into a
                    medium of art. Remilios are informed by tropes of money
                    twitter, 2010s juvenile internet culture, and schizophrenic right wing extremism
                    <br><br>
                    Remilios swept the timeline with a wave of naive, adolescent
                    energy, channeling these inspirations into the same
                    directed chaos that sets Milady apart from the monotony
                    of NFT- and crypto-twitter as a community, the same ludic
                    metairony has always been the essence of genuine internet culture.
                    <br><br>
                    He developed his distinctive take
                    on the Esoteric Sales style in a portraiture
                    series over the years, one which invokes a
                    calming, ethereal, white-hearted angelicism
                    in a blend of Western and Japanese aesthetics.
                    Remilio Maker is Milady for boys.
